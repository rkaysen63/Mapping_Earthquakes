The image above shows the location of earthquakes that have occurred around the world in the seven days prior to May 29, 2021.  The size and color are relative to the magnitude of the earthquake.  Anything less than a magnitude of 4 is colored a light yellow-green.  If a major earthquake location is selected, the popup will show the magnitude of the earthquake, its location and the date and time that the earthquake was recorded.

## Overview:bou
The maps generated by code written for this project, track earthquakes around the world that have occurred within the past seven days.  The data is retrieved from the US Geological Survey's earthquakes feed.  The map opens on the streetmap layer, but the user may choose to select a satellite street map or dark layer instead.  In addition, the map opens with three overlays that include all earthdquakes that have occurred within the past seven days, the tectonic plates boundaries, and major earthquakes that have occurred within the past seven days.  Any combination of the overlays may be turned off or on.  In addition, each overlay has popups to provide addtional information.  However, the tectonic plates layer may have to be toggled off in order to select an earthquake location for popup information.

## Files:
* style.css
  * This file provides additional style formatting of the map container and legend.
* index.html
  * This file creates the basic webpage.  It includes links to leaflet and css stylesheets and scripts to apply the JavaScript d3 library and to run config.js, layers.js and logic.js files.
* config.js 
  * This file has not been pushed to GitHub.  It contains the Open Street Map API key required to access Mapbox tile layers.
* layers.js
  * This file contains eight map layout variables, one for each of the eight Mapbox-owned styles (https://docs.mapbox.com/api/maps/styles/).  Three of the eight style variables are referenced in the challenge_logic.js code.
* challenge_logic.js
  * This file contains functions to retrieve the earthquake, major earthquake and tectonic plate data and functions add layers, overlays, and styling to the map.
